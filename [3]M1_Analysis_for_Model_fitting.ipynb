    "\n",
    "1. **Economic Theory and Relevance**: Choose variables that are theoretically and empirically relevant to \"PCE\". They should have economic justification for inclusion in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Statistical Significance**: Consider variables that have shown significant coefficients in the linear regression analysis and a strong correlation with \"PCE\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid Overfitting**: With VAR models, including too many variables can lead to overfitting and model complexity. Choose a subset that captures the essential dynamics without being overly complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dimensionality Considerations**: Given the complexity of VAR models, especially with lagged terms, itâ€™s prudent to limit the number of variables. From initial set of 123, a significantly reduced subset based on the above criteria would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Diverse Representation**: Ensure that the chosen indicators cover diverse aspects of the economy and are not too closely related to each other, to provide a comprehensive view.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Iterative Approach**: Model building can be an iterative process. Start with a smaller set of key variables and gradually add or remove variables based on model performance and diagnostics."

    "**Rationale:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithmic transformation is used to stabilize the variance in data that exhibits exponential growth or large fluctuations. This is especially crucial for datasets like FRED's, where certain indicators can show significant variability over time. Given the information from the FRED database and their suggested transformation types, it seems reasonable to align with their expertise and apply these transformations to the dataset. This approach will save time and ensure that the data is treated consistently with established economic analysis practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformation Types (as per FRED):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Transformation (1)**: The data is used as is, without any modification.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **First Difference (âˆ†x_t) (2)**: The change from one period to the next, useful for highlighting trends.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Second Difference (âˆ†^2x_t) (3)**: The change in the first difference, often used to capture acceleration or deceleration in a series.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Natural Log (log(x_t)) (4)**: Useful for stabilizing variance and making exponential growth trends linear.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **First Difference of Log (âˆ† log(x_t)) (5)**: Commonly used to convert data into a stationary series, representing percentage change.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Second Difference of Log (âˆ†^2 log(x_t)) (6)**: The change in the first difference of the log, similar to the second difference but for logged data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. **Percentage Change from Prior Period (âˆ†(x_t/x_t_âˆ’_1 âˆ’ 1.0)) (7)**: This calculates the percentage change from the previous period, emphasizing relative changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Apply Transformations:** Apply FRED Transformations and use the transformation codes provided in the `fred_indicator_mappings` dataset to transform the corresponding series in `pce_joined_dataset`.\n",
    "- This approach should streamline our analysis process and align with the methodology with FRED's established practices. \n",
    "- Additionally, it ensures that the data is treated in a manner that is suitable for economic analysis.\n",
    "-  **FRED Logarithmic Key Mapping:** We will map the transformation codes in the FREDmd_defn dataset to our dataset's indicators and then perform the necessary transformations.\n",
